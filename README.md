INDIVIDUAL_PROJECT
In summary, the project addressed data loading, cleaning, statistical exploration and visualization, identification and treatment of unusual and null values, as well as exporting specific results. Tools such as Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn were used to perform airport data analysis and visualization.

  In conclusion, the project's analysis of airport data effectively addressed several key stages of the data lifecycle. From initial loading and cleaning of the data set to statistical exploration, identification and treatment of unusual and null values, as well as visualization of results.

The implementation of the `DataLoader` class made it easier to load data from a URL, allowing greater flexibility in handling external data sets. Removing unnecessary columns and changing data types contributed to a more efficient and accurate representation of information.

Displaying key statistics, identifying unusual values, and the proportion of null values in the time zone column were covered in detail. In addition, specific operations were carried out such as the search for cities with at least one port and the extraction of airports in Spain, Madrid and Barcelona.

I can say that with this project I learned about how to do some fundamental data manipulation operations, and perform exploratory analysis, identify patterns and visualize the results effectively.

  Incidents during the project; The truth is that I did not have any major incidents since there are many sources of information and I was able to quickly get rid of any that could be presented.
  
  Perhaps how to load the data from a URL was what seemed most curious to me. And it can be done in a simpler way such as loading directly with PANDAS, since you know that the source of that data is existing. Or with the option that I chose, which was creating a class that, in addition to loading the data, does a verification of it. More than anything out of personal curiosity and why I found it interesting to present even though it may not have been strictly necessary.
  
  As a small extension, I developed a filter of the number of airports in sub-American countries, which led me to the curiosity of knowing what the airports were in my country Paraguay. since I only knew one of the existing ones.
